Fuz is a zippy stack for autonomy.
Today Fuz has a collection of libraries for making modern websites
with TypeScript, CSS, Svelte, and SvelteKit,
and soon they'll be joined by native tools written in Rust.

Fuz has no shareholders or profit motive,
so the intent is to form a nonprofit; but it's a road to get there,
and a community would have to form first.
This website will eventually have community spaces,
for now see the [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/fuzdev/fuz.dev/discussions)
to follow along and maybe help out.
